# dillma.py: Demo App for Exploring LLM Terminal Security Risks

`dillma.py` is a demo application showcasing the security risks of integrating LLMs into terminal-based tools. It demonstrates how malicious input, such as ANSI escape codes or prompt injections, can hijack terminal behavior.

## Highlights:
- Explores vulnerabilities like text formatting exploits, clipboard manipulation, and DNS leaks.
- Shows practical mitigations, including output encoding to prevent attacks.
- Helps raise awareness about handling untrusted LLM output securely.

This tool is designed for educational and research purposes, providing insight into the risks and defenses for LLM-powered CLI applications.
